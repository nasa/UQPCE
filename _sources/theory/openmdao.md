# Compatability with OpenMDAO

UQPCE is compatible to use with OpenMDAO, which is an open-source framework for multidisciplinary design, analysis, and optimization. UQPCE has analytic derivatives incorporated throughout the model, which reduced computational expense required for design under uncertainty with polynomial chaos expansion.
